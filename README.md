
Chatbot Training Project
This project focuses on training a simple chatbot using a neural network-based approach. The chatbot is designed to understand user input and generate appropriate responses based on pre-defined intents and patterns. The training process involves the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including tokenization, lemmatization, and the creation of a bag-of-words representation.

Key Components:
Intent Definition:

The project starts with defining intents, each consisting of patterns and corresponding responses, stored in a JSON file (intents.json).
Data Preprocessing:

NLTK library is employed for tokenization and lemmatization of words in the provided patterns.
Vocabulary is created by extracting unique words from patterns, ignoring specific characters.
The cleaned vocabulary is then stored in pickle files (words.pkl and classes.pkl) for later use.
Training Data Creation:

The project generates training data by converting patterns into a bag-of-words representation.
Neural network training data is created by associating each pattern with its corresponding intent label.
Neural Network Architecture:

A Sequential Neural Network is utilized for classification.
It consists of an input layer, two hidden layers with dropout for regularization, and an output layer with softmax activation for multi-class classification.
Training the Model:

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is used as the optimizer with categorical crossentropy as the loss function.
The model is trained for 200 epochs on the provided training data.
Model Saving:

The trained model is saved as chatbot_model.h5 for later use in making predictions.
Dependencies:
Python
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
TensorFlow and Keras
Instructions for Usage:
Clone the repository.
Install the required dependencies.
Run the training script (train_chatbot.py) to train the chatbot model.
The trained model (chatbot_model.h5) can then be used for chatbot interactions.
Feel free to contribute, provide feedback, or extend the project to enhance the chatbot's capabilities!
